# Django offitial tutorial practice		

This folder is the project following the instruction of django tutorial. The reason of doing this is to practice thorough process of making django based web applicaiton. Starting from the scratch of django class that I'm taking would be time consuming just for remembering rough functions and methods. With the well documented django official tutorial, I don't have to review the whole video courses again and can research furthur in to the django.

# Thorough review		

practice makes perfect skill! Good luck on myself.
